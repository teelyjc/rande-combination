# RandE Combination

## R(React.js) and E(Express.js)

## Core Concept

I'm attempting to use React.js and Express.js in a single repository.

However, commonly understood:

- React.js is just a JavaScript framework for frontend.

- Express.js is just a JavaScript framework for backend.

Many developers use react.js and express.js separately.

My goal is to combine these frameworks.

## Prerequisite

- You have to change <b>.env.example</b> to <b>.env</b>

- For change mode to `production`, You can munally change in your <b>.env</b> `NODE_ENV` to `production`.

- To start this project you can typing `pnpm run dev` in your terminal.
